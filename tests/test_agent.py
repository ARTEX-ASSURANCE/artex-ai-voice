# and would require significant mocking for true unit tests.

# Example of how a future test might look if we had a pure function:
# def format_greeting(name: str) -> str:
#     return f"Hello, {name}!"

# def test_format_greeting():
#     assert format_greeting("World") == "Hello, World!"
#     assert format_greeting("") == "Hello, !"

# For agent.py, we might consider integration tests or tests that mock external services.
# For now, this placeholder suffices for the setup.
