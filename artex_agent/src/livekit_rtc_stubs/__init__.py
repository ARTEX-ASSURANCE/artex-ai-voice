# This file makes Python treat the directory livekit_rtc_stubs as a package.
# Generated gRPC stubs for LiveKit RTC will be placed here.
# Example: livekit_rtc_pb2.py, livekit_rtc_pb2_grpc.py
# These would be generated from LiveKit's .proto files using grpc_tools.protoc.
# See README_FOR_GRPC_STUBS.txt in this directory for more details.
